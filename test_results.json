The author seems to suggest that political democracy cannot last unless there lies at the base of it social democracy, which emphasizes overcoming these social issues or challenges.\n\nDirect comparison between the two documents is difficult due to the lack of a common reference point regarding 'enemy'.

He suggests that the untouchables must educate their children and enter government services to achieve political power. Therefore, while there is an emphasis on education in both documents, Document 4 provides a more personal account of Ambedkar's struggle for education, whereas Document 6 focuses more on the need for education as a means to gain political power.",

While both documents share a common enemy in the caste system, their solutions differ.
